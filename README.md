# daily-planner

For this challenge, I made a dynamnic daily planner using HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap. Using these I created a simple calender to schedule out a workday with current hour highlighted red, past hours gray, and future hours green. Along with that, it is dynamic according to the device it is being viewed on. Lastly, inputs are stored locally and kept regardless if the application is closed.
